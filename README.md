Abstract
The project proposal aims at developing a biomass system which generate electrical energy for Meru University. The institution uses electrical energy to run most of its activities. The system intends to use human waste as the main raw material for the production of electrical energy. Human waste has a huge potential energy that is both renewable and sustainable. If it is safely collected and utilized it can provide considerable amount of energy. When human waste undergoes biodigestion biogas is produced which contains, 60% methane gas and 40% carbon dioxide. The biogas produced is combustible and is used to heat water into steam which has high kinetic energy. The steam is then used to drive generator to produce electrical energy. The system is relevant as the electricity produced can substitute the one purchased from Kenya Power hence reducing the cost. It also provide a way of managing waste, the sludge produced by the system can be used as fertilizer in the farm.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of study
Biomass is an organic matter that comprises a large variety of materials, including wood from various sources, agricultural residues and animal and human waste. Biomass can be used as a source of energy by either heating or electrical power generation.
Biomass energy can be converted into electric power in many ways, such as direct combustion of biomass materials, gasification, chemical conversion, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion. In direct combustion biomass is burnt to produce heat. Gasification involves heating biomass in controlled amounts of oxygen to produce gas and liquid fuels, Chemical conversion is the use chemical agents to convert biomass into liquid fuels. Pyrolysis produces fuels by heating biomass in the absence of oxygen. In anaerobic digestion natural gas (carbon dioxide and methane) is produced through decomposition of organic matter by bacteria in the absence of oxygen.
The efficiency of power generation from biomass differs according to the type of conversion process. In general the conversion efficiency ranges from 20% to 85%, In direct heating of biomass the efficiency is roughly 20% while in anaerobic digestion the efficiency ranges about 80%. Therefore biomass power plants that use anaerobic process can be highly efficient at energy. By comparison converting human waste into dispatchable energy the conversion efficiency of a coal power plant is 45%, this means that biomass power plants are not only environmental friendly but also considerably efficient. 





1.2 Problem statement
In this project electricity is generated using human waste and used by the university as an alternate source of power. As a learning institution many departments in the university carry out activities which largely depend on power. In turn the consumption of power is on the rise and the demand is high. Since the demand is high relatively the cost of power required is high. The electricity produced by the proposed system can supplement that from the grid in various activities. This cuts the expenditure of the university on electricity bills. The system will also help in human waste management.

1.3 Objectives 
                Main objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a biomass system which generates electricity using human waste.
                    Specific objectives
1.	To design a biodigester and articulate its installation and the pathway of flow of waste into the biodigester.
2.	To build a storage tank where the biogas is stored.
3.	Build an electrical network from the generator point to the supply with its protective measures.
1.4 Research questions
I.	What is the amount of waste produced by one person per day and the equivalent biogas produced?
II.	What is amount of energy produced by the plant for a specific quantity?
III.	What the type of generator suitable for the plant?
IV.	How the system is effective?

Hypothesis
•	If the biomass power plant is developed the cost with which the university spends on electricity bills will be greatly reduced.
•	If the biomass power plant is developed it will provide a way of managing human waste.

1.5 Justification
The purpose of study is to generate electricity utilizing the energy in human waste for Meru University. By providing this alternate source of energy the cost with which the university buys electricity will be greatly reduced. By building this system human waste is easily managed as it used as a raw material and the by-product of the process is utilized as a fertilizer.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
In the contemporary era, Biomass power plants play an important role in production of renewable energy. Biomass power plants transform biomass(organic matter) into energy as heat and then electricity. Biomass undergoes a biological breakdown/disintegration in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas. Biogas originates from biogenic material and is a type of biofuel which is generally used to describe secondary renewable fuels obtained through thermo-chemical processing or by conversion of biomass.
Biomass
Biomass is any organic matter (wood, crops, sea weed, animal/human waste) that can be used as an energy source. Biomass is probably our oldest source of energy after the sun. All organic matter contains stored energy from the sun. During a process called photosynthesis, sunlight gives plants the energy they need to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugar. These sugars called carbohydrates supply plants and animals that eat plants with energy. Food rich in carbohydrates are good source of energy for the human body

                                               Types of biomass 
1.	Agricultural waste – this category includes plant-based materials, both biological residue and energy crops.
2.	Solid waste – Includes garbage which can be utilized through varios ways like heating to produce energy.
3.	Animal/Human waste - includes manures, renderings, and other wastes from livestock finishing operations. Human waste is obtained from human.


2.1 Biogas
Biogas is a mixture of gases primarily consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, manure, municipal waste, plant waste, sewage waste and food waste. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms inside anaerobic digester.
The gases methane(CH4), hydrogen(H) and carbon monoxide(CO) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. The energy released allows biogas to be used as fuel. Biogas is considered to be a renewable source because its production and use cycle is continuous.

2.2 Anaerobic Digestion
Anaerobic digestion is a natural process and is the microbiological conversion of organic matter to methane in absence of oxygen. The decomposition is caused by natural bacterial action in various stages. It takes place in a variety of natural anaerobic environment.
The four key stages of anaerobic digestion involve hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis
•	Hydrolysis – Organic matter is made up of organic polmers, these chains must be broken down in order to access energy. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis.
•	Acidogenesis – The biological process results in further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic bacteria
•	Acetogenesis – Here simple molecules created through acidogenesis phase are further digested by acetogens to produce largely acetic acid, as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
•	Methanogenesis – Here methanogens use the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane carbon dioxide and water.

2.3 Biogas Evaluation
Nwogu Ngozi Claribelle and Izuwa Nkemakolam Chinedu in their article ‘Production of Electricity from Human Waste’ did an extensive evaluation on the use of human waste for production of electricity. The study reveals that much can there is great resource that lies in waste especially in human waste. Both single and combine cycle gas turbines were evaluated based on their capacities and electrical power output from unit volume of biomethane gas. A capacity of 696 students was taken as case study. From the results, it was realised that a total biogas volume of 35 m3 was produced daily. This gave a total biomethane volume after treatment of 22.75 m3. When this biomethane volume was used for electricity generation, it produced an electrical power of 5.21 KW per day. The results on power usage reveals that the power generated per day will serve the electrical energy needs of 626 households using a daily electrical energy of 0.2kwh, and a total of 387 households using the same energy needs of 0.2kWh.

2.4 Anaerobic digester 
The anaerobic digester is a system for biological conversion of biodegradable organic materials into methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (C0 2), water, and other gases. The microbes that produce methane gas cannot live in the presence of oxygen, so the digester must be sealed from the atmosphere.


 

                                      Size of the digester
The size of the digester (volume) Vd is determined on the basis of chosen retention time RT and the daily substrate input quantity Sd.
                        Vd = Sd * RT  (m3 = m3/day x number of days ) 
The retention time is determined by given digestate temperature, the prevailing in the digester can be assumed as 1-2 kelvin above the soil temperature. 
Averagely the amount of waste produced per person per day is 0.75 kg. The Hostels in Meru University accommodates an average of 3000 students. The hostels have an average waste of 2250 kg. Since the retention time is a period of between 30 – 40 days the digester size must be large enough to accommodate the waste for this period.
                                       Construction
A biodigester is normally made out of concrete or any other material that incubates anaerobic fermentation of organic material. It has an inlet for organic material (Human waste) and an outlet for expelling slurry. The operation of the biodigester is of a continuous nature whereby feeding is done every day. The digester will is fitted with an electronic relief valve to enable the monitoring of the effect of pressure on the composition of the biogas and the activity of the micro-organism during anaerobic digestion, the electronic valve will be adjusted every-time when a new pressure will be investigated and it will also be used to regulate the internal pressure of the digester, The impeller will be used to mix the contents of the digester. Choosing a relevant digester in practical application is a very important decision to make during the design stage. In this stage, factors such as solid material that need to be digested, the geological conditions, the shape of the digester, the yield and the availability of the construction material should be evaluated before the design is done. Materials for construction are also very important as they determine the life span of the digester.
                                                             The feeding process
The topography on which the hostel are built in the university is of a slanting nature. The digester can be built at a considerably lower point to take advantage of the physical alignment. The construction of the delivery channels is built to direct the all the waste into the biodigester.
                                                   The outlet
Digestate is the solid remnants of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. The fully decomposed digestate flows out of the digester into the expansion chamber where it is held temporary before being expelled.

                            









CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1 Biogas for Power Generation
The resulting treated biogas is sent to gas turbine for the production of electricity. The gas turbine has some inlet standards which must be met by the biogas before it is fed into it. Gas turbines requires that inlet gas be supplied at high pressures. To achieve this, gas compressors are used downstream of gas turbines to boost the biogas to the pressure required by the gas turbine inlet specification. The introduction of gas compressors will increase the cost capital cost of the biogas to electricity project. Depending on the volume of the gas, the distance and the pressure difference between the biogas in the storage tank and the inlet specification of the gas turbine, the compressors may operate in stages. 
Similar to natural gas, biogas conversion to electricity using gas turbines uses either single cycle gas turbines or combine cycle gas turbines. In combined-cycle power plant, gas and a steam turbines together are used to produce more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional single-cycle plants. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra electrical power. A combined cycle Power Plant produces high power outputs at high efficiencies (up to 60%) and with low emissions. In a conventional power plant has efficiency of about 33% electricity only and remaining 67% as waste.
3.2 Biodigester-Turbine System
3.2.1Design and Construction
The biodigester-Gas turbine system consists of the following ;
1. The toilet system (biodigester system) 
2. The biogas storage system
3. Digestate tank 
4. Treatment unit 
5. The gas compressor system 
6. The turbine system
 
                                     Biodigester System
The toilet system comprise the toilet seat which receives the human waste (excreta), the drain pipe and the septic tank, and the biogas delivery pipe. The septic tank by construction and design acts as the biogas digester. The septic tank is constructed with an opening fitted with pipe for the collection of the biogas. The system should be designed to allow removal of the sludge digestate. The digestate is the fraction of the sewage sludge remaining after the anaerobic digestion and production of biogas has taken place. If the digestate is not removed, it inhibits further biodegradation in the septic tank and slows down biogas production.
                               The Biogas Storage System 
The biogas from the septic tank (biodigester) is collected via a delivery pipe and temporarily stored in a tank. From the biogas storage tank the biogas is routed to treatment units. The storage vessel is constructed bearing in mind the volume of the biogas expected from the septic tank. The storage tank should be designed to withstand backflow of the biogas back to the septic tank.                                                                                   
                                      
                                                The Digestate tank  
The digestate is the fraction of the sewage sludge that remains after the extraction fermentation and extraction of the biogas. The digestate is the substance needed by farmers as manure or to be used in production of fertilizers.
                                  The Treatment Unit 
The raw biogas from the biogas storage is routed via pipes to the treatment unit for treatment. The raw biogas from the septic tank or biodigester contains a high percentage of CO2 and H2S and cannot be introduced into the turbine system to avoid corrosion and damage of the mechanical system of the turbine. The treatment unit is designed depending on the type of biogas treatment to be used, the desired purity of the gas and the volume of the feed biogas. The resulting treated biogas composed mainly of rich Biomethane is sent to Biomethane storage and from there it is set to the gas turbine for electricity generation.  
                                     Compressor Unit 
Gas compressors are required downstream of the turbine to compress the Biomethane to the desired pressure necessary for the gas turbine intake. The gas compressors design is dependent on the composition of the Biomethane and, the volume of the feed gas to be compressed, the distance to the turbine, the type of gas turbine in use.
                                            The turbine system
a)	Micro gas turbines
 Micro gas turbines are small high - speed gas turbines with low combustion chamber pressures and temperatures. They are designed to deliver up to 200 kW of electrical power. Micro gas turbines are essentially single cycle gas turbines that are used for small scale electricity generation. They are manufactured in compact and portable sizes and can even be used in residential buildings for electricity generation.
 


b) Steam turbine
The dry and superheated steam from the superheater is fed to the steam turbine through main valve. The heat energy of steam when passing over the blades of turbine is converted into mechanical energy. After giving heat energy to the turbine, the steam is exhausted to the condenser which condenses the exhausted steam by means of cold water circulation







3.3 Estimation of biogas produced

According to the study by Ngozi on human waste the following parameters were obtained.

 

The total number number of students residing in the hostels is 3000.
The average mass of human waste produced per person per day is 0.5 kg.
The total mass of waste produced per day is 1500 kg/day.
From table, dry matter content of human waste is 35%.
 Total dry matter mass of daily waste produced = 0.35 x 1500kg = 525kg 
Carbon content of dry matter in the human waste = 24% 
Total carbon content in the total human waste produced per day = 0.24 x 525 kg = 126 kg 
From table above, the % biodegradability of human waste is 60% for volatile solids and 50% for total solids. 
Assuming volatile solids. The mass of biodegradable matter = 0.6 x 126 kg = 75.6 kg (this is the carbon that will be converted to Biogas). 
In the biogas, 65% of the biogas is methane 
Mass of Methane carbon (CH4-C) = 75.6 kg x 0.65 = 49.14 kg 
Molar mass of methane = 16g and molar mass of carbon =12g Mass of Methane = 49.14 kg x 16/12 = 65.52 kg
At normal temperature and pressure, NTP (i.e. 20°C and 1 atm), the density of methane = 0.668 kg/m3. 
Thus the volume of methane biogas produced = mass/density 
Volume of methane in the biogas = 98.08 m3 
Note that this volume of methane corresponds to the 65% in the total biogas stream generated. 
Thus the total volume of biogas generated = 150.89 m3.
 
3.4 Estimation of the Electrical Equivalent of the Biogas
1kwh = 3.6MJ 
Gas turbine efficiency affects heat rate. 100% efficient gas turbine will generate 3.6MJ/Kwh.
From table, the calorific value of pure methane is about 42MJ/m3 – 45MJ/m3 The calorific value of biogas depends on the percentage concentration of Methane in the biogas since methane is the only constituent of the biogas that has heating value. Raw biogas has heating value from 20-26MJ/ m3 , the CO2 concentration of the biogas lowers the heating value. CO2 removal and biogas treatment is done to increase the heating value and reduce corrosion tendencies of the gas. For this study, the Biomethane from the biogas has a percentage composition of 95% and a caloric value of 36 MJ/m3 . Thus, a 100% efficient gas turbine utilising biomethane with calorific value 36MJ/m3 will generate 10 kWh /m3 For a combine cycle gas turbine with 55% efficiency, the biomethane consumption of the turbine = 10 kWh /m3 x 0.55 =5.5 kWh /m3 .
The electrical power to be produced from the hostels for 150.89 m3 volume of methane = 5.5 kWh x 150.89 m3 = 829.9 kWh. 






CHAPTER FOUR: EXPECTED RESULTS/OUTPUT
At the end of the project, the system is expected to generate electricity to Meru University Of Science and Technology. The human waste from the hostels is collected into the bio-digester. This waste is decomposed and biogas is produced and channeled to the storage tank. Biogas is then supplied to the combustor where it is heated to drive the micro gas turbine which in turn drives the first generator. The hot gases are then passed to the evaporator. In the evaporator heat from the hot gases is utilized to generate steam. the high pressurized steam is used to drive the steam turbine which is coupled to the second generator. The two generators generate electricity which is supplied to the output.
